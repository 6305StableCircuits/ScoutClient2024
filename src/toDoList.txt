bugs (High Priority):
undo/redo seems to have some point value issues (charged score should change score more than regular score)

bugs (Low Priority)
undo/redo incorrectly lists what it is undoing/redoing (at least when using the intake menus)
confirmation prompt shows even with empty data or finished game
summary incorrectly lists several things
