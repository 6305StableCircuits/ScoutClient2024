High Priority (haven't started, or needs to be finished)

*save edited export data [abandoned, not enough time and too many bugs]*

*make undo/redo remove/add back intake/shotlogs [not started yet]*

bugs (High Priority):
undo/redo seems to have some point value issues (charged score should change score more than regular score)

bugs (Low Priority)
confirmation prompt shows even with finished game
summary incorrectly lists several things
checkmarks on exportdata do nothing [probably won't be fixed]
